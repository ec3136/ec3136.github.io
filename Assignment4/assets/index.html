        More recently, he has started making and selling more risograph prints. Risography is a printing process that combines photocopying and silkscreening. It works by printing a single color at a time, layering the ink to create the image.

        He makes these prints in two primary styles, one that resembles minimalistic line drawings. The other more similar to his ball-point pen work, which depict animals. 
        In this printing style, he is able to use a greater variety of color, though he doesn't always choose to.
