            <div id="second"><h3>14.</h3> The society which rests on modern industry is not accidentally or superficially spectacular, it is fundamentally spectaclist.

            <div id="third"> <h3>16.</h3>The spectacle subjugates living men to itself to the extent that the economy has totally subjugated them. It is no more than the economy developing for itself. It is the true reflection of the production of things, and the false objectification of the producers.
